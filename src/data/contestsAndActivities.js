      "Won 3rd place and $500 at the first offline Sui hackathon in Poland after joining late, hacking solo, and with no prior Sui or Move experience.",
    longDescription: `This was a spontaneous adventure. On a Friday evening, with no weekend plans, I found out about the first-ever offline Sui hackathon in Poland happening in Wroclaw. The catch? It had already started that morning, I hadn't applied, and I knew nothing about Sui or the Move language.

Still, I took a leap of faith. I applied, jumped into their Telegram group, and asked if I could join late on Saturday. To my surprise, the organizers were incredibly welcoming, so I bought my tickets right away.

I took the "Kulturbahn" to Wroclaw, where, in a surprising turn of events, I was handed a massive pair of scissors for a traditional "Scherenschnitte" paper-cutting session on the train.

{{gdrive_embed[0]}}

The hospitality continued at the venue, where they even let me sleep on-site. I was the only one camping out and got a friendly 6 AM wake-up call in Polish. While I didn't understand a word, I figured it was time to start coding, not to go back to sleep. It's all part of the hackathon lore!

{{gdrive_embed[1]}}

The Sui team was fantastic. They treated us to a great dinner and were endlessly patient with my beginner questions, which was a huge help.

{{gdrive_embed[2]}}

I hacked solo, wrote my first Move smart contract, and built a word-joining dApp where users could mint the words they composed. You can check it out live on devnet at [batikanor.com/sui](https://batikanor.com/sui). Against all odds, I won 3rd place and $500!

If you'd like to try the app, note that you should have a slush wallet, and use the openrouter endpoints. Start playing by clicking on a word, and then you'll figure the rest out. You need some devnet faucet tokens, and then you can mint the words you compose and put whatever image you want on them. Note that I didn't bother with IPFS, since this was just a demo.

A huge thank you to Oleksandr (1st place winner), Alex and Andrii from Sui, Adam Welc from Mysten Labs, and the entire community for making it an unforgettable experience.

They said they'll even ship me a My 3rd place trophy all the way to Cottbus. Looking forward to it!`,

    longDescription: `I was the lead jury and mentor at the climate hack competition organized by Decarbon Days together with BTU Cottbus University (Germany) and Zielona Gora University (Poland).

I was joined by professors from both universities and industry partners as the other jury. After we thoroughly considered all pitches, I handed the prizes to the winning team, which presented a Reinforcement Learning-based solution to optimize energy usage and balance loads across multiple machines in factories. What mainly led them to win was their openness to improve themselves throughout the competition, and also the more realistic and feasible first steps they shared for what they can do after the climathon. There were a few other potential candidates for the win, but we believe this team deserved it.

It was a great experience meeting with partners and politicians who are knowledgeable and interested in climate and energy, and I'm thankful to the organizers for considering me for this important role.

Thank you to zweihelden gmbh for making this possible. A special thank you to Neela-Medea Löder for her efforts in realizing the climathon.

      "Winner with distinction 'Open Source' in Music & AI Hackathon in Japan. Participation in World Expo as VIP of Austria",
    mapData: {
      venue: "Gyokuzoin Temple, Mount Shigi",
      city: "Nara",
      country: "Japan",
      coordinates: { lat: 34.6128, lng: 135.6682 }, // Mount Shigi, Nara - actual location of Gyokuzoin Temple

    shortDescription:
      "Built 'Slai' - an innovative VR-pen based music equalizer system using Logitech MX Ink, allowing musicians to control frequency bands through spatial movements. Won Open Source distinction and participated in World Expo 2025.",
    longDescription: `We were given the incredible opportunity to have a free trip to Japan where the World Expo 2025 was taking place. We first worked on music and AI challenges in a Buddhist temple called 'Gyokuzoin Temple' on Mount Shigi in Nara Prefecture, and built a solution using Logitech's VR-pen, the MX Ink.

{{gdrive_embed[5]}}

We designed the pen to function as an equalizer. You map frequency bands to one of the x, y, or z axes and then simply move the pen around to hear the music change in real-time. We called our project 'Slight Adjustments with AI', or 'Slai'. We brought our prototype to a working state and let fellow participants interact with the system at a demo station we set up.

{{gdrive_embed[0]}}

The VR-pen features multiple infrared emitters, enabling precise 3D tracking through devices like the Meta Quest 3. We couldn't rely on GPS or simple computer vision tracking for this project, as these methods lack the precision required for applications like orchestral conducting or professional DJing.

However, the pen's tracking depends on remaining within the Quest headset's field of vision, which we considered acceptable for our proof of concept.

{{gdrive_embed[1]}}

On the left side of our interface, we displayed a real-time plot showing the pen's trajectory in 3D space for a user-defined time period (e.g., last 2 seconds). On the right side, you see the equalizer with frequency bands that can be mapped to the x, y, or z axes. The rightmost section features a 'click me' button for selecting specific tracks (such as a drumbeat, or perhaps [Chicken Attack by Takeo Ischi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miomuSGoPzI)), allowing users to control mid-tones with the y-dimension and piano with the z-dimension while adjusting drumbeat volume through the equalizer (where values <0 disable the drumbeat).

{{gdrive_embed[2]}}

In our demo video, we mapped the x-dimension to a drumbeat and the z and y dimensions to some frequency bands for a Mozart piece. Note that I'm not a musician, so please judge the solution independently of my musical control skills! I intentionally used extreme settings to make the functionality clearly visible to the audience.

This video demonstrates the working system, though I was sleep-deprived during recording. I held the pen too high, making some movements less visible on the left plot (trust me, it normally displays beautifully), and as someone without musical training, I focused on demonstrating extreme volume variations across frequency bands rather than subtle adjustments. I also forgot to scroll down to show the complete mapping interface. Ideally, I'd re-record this demo with better preparation, but given the hackathon's nature (<24 hours of working time with limited internet access in a temple in Japan, where we also wanted to explore and travel), what did you expect—a perfect pitch?

We experimented with using pen velocity (direct, 10ms, 100ms averages) and even acceleration (direct, 10ms, 100ms averages) instead of position, but concluded this felt unnatural for conductors. When a conductor raises their baton and holds it there, they expect the orchestra to maintain that dynamic level. Position matters: pen up, orchestra up. Of course, this creates the challenge of establishing the reference point (0,0,0), which we address through VR pen synchronization. However, we didn't advance our PoC enough to enable seamless reference point recalibration, which limited our live demo's effectiveness. We had ambitious plans—imagine playing Mozart, then suddenly stepping right and switching to [Chicken Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miomuSGoPzI) to surprise the audience! It would've been magnificent.

{{gdrive_embed[3]}}

The name 'Slight Adjustments with AI' reflects our vision: pen movements should create subtle musical changes, which we still believe represents the ideal final product. However, for our demo, we showcased extreme variations instead of subtle adjustments because, as non-musicians, it would've been difficult to convince the audience the system was working otherwise.

Our project is open source (check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/batikanor/slai)) and we invite others to draw inspiration and explore the pen's capabilities through different approaches. We implemented two 'backends' and one 'frontend'—if these terms still mean anything today—essentially ensuring location data flowed correctly to the source application where musical parameters could be configured.

{{gdrive_embed[4]}}

We had the honor of meeting and listening to [Maywa Denki](https://youtu.be/g_1WvxYBGTk), founder of the Otamatone, who, like us, was invited as a VIP of Austria to the expo. What a talented musician!

Thank you to everyone for this incredible event! Special thanks to [Florian Bauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bauer-a230b333/) and [Nobuko Okazaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nobuko-okazaki-79253233/) for the outstanding organization!

Out of the 40+ attending teams who went through the initial screening, we were one of the few to make it to the final. I made a very impressive pitch, after which I was contacted by multiple people from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and Ukrainian/European defense companies. We were even given some implicit opportunities to test the system.

My teammate Emil had already built the radar system, which costs far less than the more expensive systems, though still more than a thousand dollars. My contribution was to help get the system running in our demo setting and provide the AI implementation to enable the detection and classification of drones up to a satisfactory range. Due to the confidential nature of the sector, I cannot share any more details.

We built an innovative GraphRAG solution using Mistral AI, OpenAI, and Neo4j to indicate how financial markets might be influenced by current geopolitical events. By comparing them to previous cases with similar characteristics, it could project similar outcomes and warn users if their portfolio might be affected. We developed a cool solution with a Nuxt.js platform that allows you to interact with future scenarios by prompting how 'x' might affect 'y'—for example, how France leaving the EU would affect its economy in the long run.

      "Out of the 100+ teams that attended from 88 universities across Europe, our team (Fırat Fuat Olcay, Serdar Pehlivan & me) was one of the winners of the Huawei 2024 Munich Tech Arena competition! Our team represented Turkey & Germany (Since we all did our bachelor's at the Turkish-German University in Istanbul), and we were the only team representing Turkey. \n\n The competition, held from September 2024 to January 2025, was related to generating precise individual HRTFs (head related transfer functions) associated with the listener's anthropometric data based on multi-view pinna images. Winner teams were determined through a leaderboard of accuracy scores (which is nice. Can be more objective than jury decisions, but not always better).      \n\n\n\n In case you are interested in our method, feel free to check out the slides attached below. \n\n",

      "In this paper, we investigate offline reinforcement learning (RL) with the goal of training a single robust policy that generalizes effectively across environments with unseen dynamics. We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.",

This innovative approach trains students to maintain focus and composure under exam conditions.",
    longDescription:
      "Our project, 'MX Focus,' is a virtual reality application aimed at improving students' concentration during examinations. In this immersive VR classroom, students are equipped with a Logitech MX Ink VR pen and a Muse 2 EEG headband. The system monitors the student's focus levels; if a decline is detected, simulated handwriting degradation occurs, encouraging the student to maintain concentration. The VR environment replicates a real classroom, with virtual papers aligned to the physical desk. Teachers can input or modify questions in real-time via a Google Docs document, which updates instantly in the VR space. This setup allows for dynamic interaction between teachers and students, facilitating tasks such as math problem-solving. By introducing challenges like simulated handwriting issues when focus wanes, our application aims to train students to remain calm and attentive under exam conditions. We believe that regular use of 'MX Focus' can help students develop resilience and improve performance in high-pressure academic settings. We made it to the finals, and we were gifted MX Ink pens of around 200 usd value per piece for our efforts.",

    The pipeline we implemented works as follows:
    
    0) Assume you are working for marketing of Austria to tourists, and you are currently in a conference in Dubai. You have some 'technical stuff' in your stand, with which you draw attention. 
    \n
    1) You use a Muse 2 headband (see link 1) to collect EEG data from your visitor. Whilst doing that, the visitor is viewing semi-abstract images related to potential hobbies.
    
    2) Our program is extracting simple features from the collected EEG data, such as how concentrated the visitor is in every brief moment, and how strong their emotions are. We are especially keeping track of these for the brief moments (1 sec) each image is shown. For example, the frontal alpha asymmetry is calculated as: log(right_alpha) - log(left_alpha)  
    
    3) With the help of data from step 2 and raw EEG data passed through neural networks, we extract the 'big 5 personality traits' (see link 2).  

    4) We feed the data from steps 2 and 3 into an LLM, and fetch the recommended travel spot through RAG from aforementioned travel hotspots in austria datasets. The LLM also provides an explanation regarding the decision.
    

    This was the first time our team worked with EEG data, and we only had 24 hours to complete everything. During the event we had conflicts within the team but we didn't let these stop us from winning. We got 1st place out of 25+ teams.

    We've taken inspiration from Klados et al (link 3).





    I wanted to share the code here, but we private'd the repository due to the wishes of some of our team members.

GreenDoor operates as a “Glassdoor for Sustainability,” providing employees with an anonymous platform to rate and review their companies’ environmental and sustainability efforts. This tool empowers employees to highlight their company’s commitment—or lack thereof—to sustainable practices, encouraging companies to improve based on transparent feedback.

The platform supports sustainable decision-making and aligns with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by structuring survey questions around these objectives. To ensure relevance and accuracy, we aim to partner with sustainability certification bodies and industry ranking organizations to provide integrated insights. With a freemium model, GreenDoor offers free public data access while monetizing through premium features, such as predictive analytics for companies on meeting sustainability targets and advertisement placements for sustainability-focused job positions. Additionally, advanced AI-based bot detection and authentication methods guarantee data reliability and user anonymity.

Our roadmap includes launching the platform in Zurich, gathering initial data, and progressively expanding features and geographic reach as data volume and revenue grow. GreenDoor aims not only to inform potential employees but also to encourage proactive change, providing companies with critical insights into employee expectations around sustainability. By fostering a community-driven approach to sustainable corporate transparency, GreenDoor breaks down barriers between employees and employers, opening the door to a greener, more accountable future for businesses.`,

    shortDescription: `Cost minimization for tenants and landlords through energy management using AI (multivariate forecasters, neural networks, …), and Mathematical Optimization (interior-point methods)  (Role: FullStack, Cloud, RL).`,
    longDescription: `The challenge was to minimise costs for single & multiple family households through self-devised energy management methods, and provide the tenants and landlord(s) with utility functions. We were provided real and/or realistic data to work with from industry experts. We won first place with our solution called “Bright Grid”. To summarise, we formulated 2 mathematical optimization problems and used multiple forecasting-related AI solutions to tackle the challenge. My role in the team was full stack development, cloud deployment, and universal forecasting experimentation. Our main mathematical optimization was minimising the energy cost through distributing the load across battery, PV, and grid using forecasted data and under reasonable constraints. Our secondary optimization was to help the landlord increase their profits when selling electricity to the tenants. We mainly used interior-point methods for optimization, for we found them to be sufficient for PoC. We considered a later switch to ADMM. Our forecasts were made through both real and mocked data, using Moirai (universal multivariate time series forecasting), conventional neural networks, etc. We deployed on azure in two separate containers (BE, FE).`,

Using the VitalDB dataset where there is a great count of sensor readings of thousands of patients available online, we modelled and trained an AI model that can predict whether there’ll be a ‘shock’ in the coming 30 seconds / 2.5 minutes / 5 minutes. We reached test accuracies ranging from 70% to 90% using the methods we developed, and demonstrated them live using the aforementioned monitor. We had a doctor in the team who guided us towards measuring shock index (SI) as HRT / ART_SBP. For predictions we experimented with different models, but within the limited time and without access to GPUs, we could only prepare our LSTM model in time (even on that model we had made simple training mistakes, which we could only -to some extent- fix in the last minutes of the event), with which we reached the aforementioned accuracies. We also had working code to extract frequency information from some sensor readings using Mexican hat wavelet transformations, but even though we made use of as much multithreading as we could think, we couldn’t transform all the necessary data within the given time. We also had trouble finding pretrained autoencoders/embedders with which we could embed the data in order to put it into more explainable models. My role in the team was mainly participating in AI brainstorming sessions and trying to implement respective transformations and hopefully run explainable models. The jury and other Dräger employers especially praised our team for demonstrating ‘order in chaos’ and shared expertise on the domain. The source code is confidential and thus cannot be shared here.`,

      Turkish-German University is founded through the shared intentions of the Turkish & German governments, and even though the university is located in Istanbul, the lectures are 100% in German. There's this system that they call 'Flying Faculty', where half of our lecturers are coming from various german Universities through DAAD funding. This is a pretty neat thing, since it allows you to network with professors from Berlin, Aachen, Magdeburg, ...
      \n
    
      Whilst TGU isn't the hardest university to get into, students still need to perform better than 99% of the country in the nationwide university entrance exam to get in.
      \n
      I was rarely the best student of an invidividual class, and I also was often not the most hardworking or the most intelligent student of a class. However, I consistently got good grades from all classes I took, which enabled me to graduate from computer science (Informatik / Bilgisayar Mühendisliği) program of TGU with a GPA of 4.00/4.00, and become the first graduate of any faculty of TGU with a perfect GPA. TGU is a relatively young university, and I owe my success partially to that. In the end of the day, this is a great thing to put on my CV, but it doesn't really make my future path better than other graduates of TGU. I just have one good-looking thing in my CV, and that's it. It feels weird to mention this in interviews, too. It sounds a bit too 'proud' to mention it. I still end up mentioning it sometimes... What can I do? I'm just trying to market myself...
